# StocSVEIR
Functions for  simulations of Stochastic multitype SEIR model, with the inclusion of Vaccinated states

-----------------
We will use a multitype SEIR model accounting for vaccination states for COVID-19 data in Greece.
We include 2 scenarios for the vaccinations.

Scenario 1: susceptibles are given the second dose after 3 periods of the first dose,
having a  drop in immunity each month (length of the period and the drop in immunity are user defined).

Scenario 2: susceptibles are given the second dose on the recommended timeline.
