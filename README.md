**Abstract: 
This paper is concerned with a simulation-based evaluation of a number of strategies for vaccine rollout. This is a pressing question for several countries worldwide and the adopted policy shall affect the easing of the non-pharmaceutical interventions during the next few months. We use a suitably modified stochastic multitype SEIR (Susceptible -> Exposed -> Infectious -> Removed) Epidemic model to include the effect of distinct vaccination strategies. The number of social contacts among distinct age-groups are informed by a recent survey conducted in Greece. The results are summarised in terms of the total number of deaths and infections as well as life years lost. The optimal strategy appears to be based on maximising the intermediate time-interval between the two doses given for all the individuals below 75 years old. This policy, pertaining to the approach adopted in the UK, seems worthwhile in the presence of a limited vaccine supply.**
